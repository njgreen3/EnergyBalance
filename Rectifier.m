%RECTIFIER Summary of this function goes here
%   This function simulates a three phase rectifier for an energy balance 
%   microgrid model.
%   The losses in a switching based rectifier are generally broken up into
%   losses during conduction through the switching device and losses during
%   the switch transition (turning on and off). Switching devices include
%   transistors and diodes.
